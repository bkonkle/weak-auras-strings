Taken from [Redfella's Icy Veins forum post](http://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/10380-redfellas-unholy-necroticblight-weakauras/), and tweaked a bit. All credit goes to [Redfella](http://www.icy-veins.com/forums/user/17369-redfella/), and to [Demonardvark](http://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/10247-demonardvarks-unholy-dk-necroblight-guide/) for pioneering the playstyle.

Changes:

* Hid the "Death Coil  if RP < 90 & DT duration > 10s" icon from the rotation helper, since I only want something to show up there if I should act on it
* Added an icon to the cooldown helper for the Orc racial ability Blood Fury
